# Scheduling Program

This C program calculates the waiting times (Tw) and turnaround times (Tr) for three scheduling algorithms: FCFS (First-Come, First-Served), SJF (Shortest Job First), and RR (Round Robin).

## Features

- **FCFS**: Calculates waiting and turnaround times using the FCFS scheduling algorithm.
- **SJF**: Calculates waiting and turnaround times using the SJF scheduling algorithm.
- **RR**: Not currently implemented in the provided code, but intended for the Round Robin scheduling algorithm.

## Compilation

To compile the program, use the `make` command:

```sh
make
```
This will generate an executable called my_program.

## Execution
To run the program, use the make run command:

```sh
make run
```

The program will prompt you to input the number of processes and their arrival times (Ti) and burst times (Di). Additionally, for the RR algorithm, it will ask for the quantum time.

## Code Structure
main.c: Contains the main code for calculating waiting and turnaround times, and handling input and output.
Cleanup
To clean up the files generated by compilation, use:

```sh
make clean
```

This will remove the `main` executable.

Notes
Make sure you have gcc installed on your system to compile the program. The code is designed to run on Unix-like systems.
